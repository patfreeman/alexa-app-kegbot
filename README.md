# alexa-app-kegbot
alexa-app-kegbot is an [alexa-app](https://github.com/matt-kruse/alexa-app) module for communication with your Kegbot. Currently is supports the following:
* What's on tap?
* How much is left?

For a more corporate friendly setup, maybe the Lambda version is better: [alexa-lambda-kegbot](https://github.com/patfreeman/alexa-lambda-kegbot)

### Requirements
* node (v0.12 or greater) - NodeJS http://nodejs.org 
* request - NodeJS package https://www.npmjs.com/package/request
* alexa-app - NodeJS package https://www.npmjs.com/package/alexa-app
* alexa-app-server - NodeJS package https://www.npmjs.com/package/alexa-app-server used to host the app
* AWS Developer account from https://developer.amazon.com to create skill

1. Configure alexa-app-server
  1. `cd ~/node_modules/alexa-app-server/api`

    1. Configure the SSL port to listen on. Insert this line before the 'port:' line.
`httpsEnabled : true, httpsPort : 8443, privateKey:'private-key.pem', certificate:'certificate.pem',`
  1. Generate the SSL cert by following the directions on https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/testing-an-alexa-skill#create-a-private-key-and-self-signed-certificate-for-testing
    1. `mkdir sslcert`

    1. `openssl genrsa -out private-key.pem 2048`
    1. `vi configuration.cnf` only change the options in the req_distinguished_name and subject_alternate_names stanzas to match your external DNS name (see example file from amazon documentation)

  1. Test the connection by going to https://<your_external_dns_name>:<https_port>/alexa/kegbot/
    1. You should get a page that says "This is a simple testing utility to POST to your endpoint and simulate an Alexa request" at the top and have a few text boxes on it.

    1. Try it with a sample utterance by typing "whats on tap" into the "Enter Utterance" textbox and click Ask!
1. Try talking to Alexa

### Troubleshooting
If you are having issues along the install path, you might find it useful to follow some better documentation than I can write. I started this project after stumbling through hooking my Alexa up to my OpenHAB Home Automation system using [Alexa-HA](https://github.com/unityfire/alexa-ha) written by [unityfire](https://github.com/unityfire). There is much better documentation about getting alexa-app-server up and running in the documentation for Alexa-HA.
